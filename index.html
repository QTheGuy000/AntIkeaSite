      <p1 style="color:yellow;" class ="body"><br>An auto runner where you play as the former boss of (Unnamed Department Store) in his quest to wreck the store and prove that the new boss is an incompetent fool. Destroy chairs, eat meatballs, jump on furniture, and anything else that can help you achieve your job of getting your old job back. The obstacles will be randomly generated and you'll be able to explore different locations within the store. Rack up your score by running through the warehouse and not running into heavy furniture. This game is a side scrolling endless runner inspired by hit classics such as Jetpack Joyride and Subway Surfers. It's very easy to pick up and play and is fun for everyone with no advertisement nonsense.<br></p1>

     <p1 style="color:yellow;" class ="body"><br>With a grand total of 2 completely unique areas to explore, rack up your score through grabbing coins and breaking chairs. You'll enter a new location once your score reaches a certain amount. You'll take damage if you hit the side of a heavy object like a bed or a dresser and some heavy objects require 2 jumps to get over them. Eat some meatballs to restore health. Your game ends once your health reaches 0. Try to get as high of a score as you can.<br><br></p1>
